\section*{Acknowlegements}
I want to thank my supervisors for the support and fruitful discussions and comments at times when the project seemed useless. I am grateful for my advisors time and patiance with reading the unreadable mess that are the drafts of this thesis. Special thanks go to the Technion's Accelerated Computing Systems Lab for providing access to the Intel Tofino hardware and all explanations required to understand its undocumented behaviors. Further, I would like to thank the TU Dresden Operating Systems group for integrating me in the last couple of years and exposing me to a variety of topics while always supporting my desire to study abroad and allowing me to write my diploma thesis in cooperation with the ACSL.\@

I thank the Minerva Foundation of the Max-Planck Society and the EU's Erasmus+ program for funding my research stay at the Technion -\@ Israel Institute of Technology.
